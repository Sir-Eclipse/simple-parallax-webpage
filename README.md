# simple-parallax-webpage
 This is a repository of a simple parallax webpage made using HTML and CSS.

This is my first web development project. I have made a simple parallax webpage by using basic HTML and CSS. 
A parallax webpage is a page with fixed images in the background and the page can be scrolled down to see more parts of the image.
I will use basic tags like div, paragraph and heading to make the HTML part of the page.
The most important element of the CSS part is the background so I will give the page the "background-attachment: fixed;" to create the actual parallax effect.
